Replication of Highman's Matrix exponential times a vector algorithm. 

All the derivation, calculations and figures are compiled in MIT_18.335_Final Project.pdf file. 

Guidelines on Matlab files
impexpmv is my implementation and corresponds to Algorithm 2 in the paper
parameters is also my implementation and corresponds to Algorithm 1 in the paper
Benchmarking has codes that generate fig 1,2,and 3 in the paper
All the rest of the matlab files were implemented by Higham and downloaded from mathlab file Exchange

Gridelines on Julia Functions 
function parameters corresponds to Algorithm 1 in the paper
function impexp corresponds to Algorithm 2 in the paper
function densityinv calculate relative error for different matrix density
function impexp_tol compute relative error vs numbers of matrix vector multiplication for different tolerance
